- Efficient local branching
- Convenient staging areas
- Flexible workflows
- Distributed development model

## üîÑ Common Git Workflows

### Feature Branch Workflow

1. Create a branch for a new feature: `git checkout -b new-feature`
2. Make changes and commit: `git commit -am "Add new feature"`
3. Push to remote: `git push origin new-feature`
4. Create a pull request for review
5. Merge into main branch after approval

### Gitflow Workflow

- `main` branch contains production code
- `develop` branch for ongoing development
- Feature branches for new features
- Release branches for release preparation
- Hotfix branches for urgent production fixes
