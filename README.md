[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/star3am/hashiqube?quickstart=1)

## Overview

Hashiqube is the Ultimate Hands on DevOps Lab in a Docker Container.
It can run in a Github Codespace, Locally using Vagrant or Docker Compose, or as a Virtual Machine VM on AWS, GCP and Azure.

Hashiqube has a Docker daemon inside meaning, 
we can run containers inside Hashiqube using Kubernetes (Minikube) or Nomad or Docker run. It runs all Hashicorp products. [Vault](/vault/?id=vault), [Terraform](/terraform/?id=terraform), [Nomad](/nomad/?id=nomad), [Consul](/consul/?id=consul), [Waypoint](/waypoint/?id=waypoint), [Boundary](/boundary/?id=boundary), [Vagrant](/vagrant/?id=vagrant), [Packer](/packer/?id=packer) and [Sentinel](/sentinel/?id=sentinel).

It also runs a host of other popular Open Source DevOps/DevSecOps applications (Minikube, Ansible AWX Tower, Traefik etc.) showcasing how simple integration with Hashicorp products can result in tangible learnings and benefits for all its users.

Once Hashiqube is up an internet connection is no longer needed meaning sales pitches and demos for potential and existing customers are greatly aided.

Hashiqube has been created to help Engineers, Developers and anyone who wants to practise, learn or demo HashiCorp products to get started quickly with a local lab.

* Watch the video below for follow-along instructions 

[![HashiQube on Github's Codespaces](images/hashiqube-on-github-codespace.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uDfDnQZZoA)

## Hashiqube Locally
Follow the instructions below to run Hashiqube locally on your laptop or PC. 

### Pre-requisites
* 10GB of disk space and 4G RAM (Minimum) - 8G RAM Recommended
* Docker
* Vagrant

:bulb: If you want to run Minikube and a workload like AWX Ansible Tower, or Airflow you need at least 8G RAM - If you want to run Gitlab as well, you need to give Docker resources at least 12G RAM

### Installation Instructions
:clock3: Duration 15 - 30 minutes <br>
:bulb: Docker is the Default and preferred way to run Hashiqube

* Docker - Download Docker from the [Docker desktop installer](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and install
* Vagrant - Download Vagrant from the [Vagrant installer](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and install
* Using `git` - clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/star3am/hashiqube.git` - [What is Git?](git/#git)
* Inside the local repo folder, do `vagrant up --provision` - This will set up, Vault, Nomad, Consul, Terraform, Localstack and Docker
* Documentation locally available at http://localhost:3333

### Docker Compose
Docker compose is also supported! To bring up Hashiqube with Docker Compose do the following 

* Docker - Download Docker from the [Docker desktop installer](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and install
* Using `git` - clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/star3am/hashiqube.git` - [What is Git?](git/#git)
* Inside the local repo folder, do `docker-compose up -d` This will bring up Hashiqube

Now run the following commands:
`docker compose exec hashiqube /bin/bash` This will drop you into Hashiqube as root, now you can bring up the individual services, start with Basetools <br />
`bash hashiqube/basetools.sh` This will install a bunch of dependencies<br />
`bash docker/docker.sh` This will install the Docker Daemon inside <br />Hashiqube
`bash vault/vault.sh` This will bring up HashiCorp Vault<br />

And so on, you get the idea..

See: 
`docker compose ls`
```
NAME                STATUS              CONFIG FILES
hashiqube           running(1)          /Users/riaan/workspace/personal/hashiqube/docker-compose.yml
```

## HashiQube Diagrams

In essence, Hashiqube is a Docker Container (by default) or a Virtual Machine.

Hashiqube has a Docker Daemon inside meaning we can run docker containers/pods inside Hashiqube using Kubernetes or Nomad or Docker run.

Hashiqube runs on your local laptop, PC or a cloud instance.

Hashiqube runs all the Hashicorp products and other popular Open Source tools, such as Minikube, Ansible AWX Tower, Prometheus and Grafana and many, many more, see: [Hashiqube Integrations](/?id=hashiqube-integrations)

You can also run Hashiqube on AWS, GCP and Azure. This is called Hashiqube Multi-Cloud, see: [Multi-Cloud](multi-cloud/README)

Hashiqube is a Training / Development Lab for you to practise, learn or demo POC stuff with, it should not be run in production.

Hashiqube can be visualized with the diagrams below.

## HashiQube's Purpose
Hashiqube has been created to enable anyone who is interested in secure automation pipelines the ability to run a suite of ‘best in class’ tools on their local machines at the cost of a small amount of system resources.

Hashiqube gives all interested parties the empowerment to  deploy these tools in a way that covers multiple use cases effectively providing a ‘concept to completion’ test bed using open-source Hashicorp products.

The original use case was born from the desire to demystify DevSecOps utilising Terraform, Vault, Consul, Sentinel and Nomad as well as some other well known open source CI/CD tools by providing a ‘hands-on’ environment that demonstrates the value of secret and credential management in a standard software development pipeline.

Thanks to the flexibility of the Hashicorp products there is no need to wonder how to achieve the goals of bringing software to market in a more secure and timely fashion, just Vagrant up!

## Supported HashiCorp product Versions

By default Hashiqube installs community editions of Hashicorp products, but you can also test and demo Enterprise versions. You can request a trial license from here https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/enterprise/hashicorp-enterprise-license#request-a-trial-license

When you get the license file, simply copy the license.hclic into the vault or corresponding product folder in the hashiqube directory and run:

`vagrant up --provision-with basetools,vault,consul,nomad,boundary`

| Name | Community | Enterprise |
|------|--------|------------|

## Components
Hashiqube is made up of a number of components and some rely on each other like building blocks.

For example, you can run components separately as demonstrated below.
```bash
vagrant up --provision-with basetools
vagrant up --provision-with docker
vagrant up --provision-with docsify
vagrant up --provision-with vault
vagrant up --provision-with consul
vagrant up --provision-with nomad
vagrant up --provision-with minikube
```

Or one-shot as demonstrated below.
```bash
vagrant up --provision-with basetools,docker,minikube,postgresql,dbt,apache-airflow
```

#### Docker Desktop
Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac or Windows environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. It's a graphical user interface for the docker service.

* [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and install it on your laptop, to verify and bring up the Docker Desktop application. 

If you have HashiQube running, you won't see any containers but you will be able to open the application. 

![Docker Desktop](images/docker_desktop_installed.png?raw=true "Docker Desktop")

Now that docker is installed we need to ensure that the docker environment and settings are configured

- Ensure you have the latest version installed
- Ensure that your Operating System is updated, see: [Speed boost achievement unlocked on Docker Desktop 4.6 for Mac](https://www.docker.com/blog/speed-boost-achievement-unlocked-on-docker-desktop-4-6-for-mac/)

##### Docker Desktop Resources

:bulb: You can quite happily run Hashiqube with 4G (minimum)  or 8G (recommended) of RAM, but once you start running, Vault, Nomad, Consul, Waypoint, Boundary AND you want to run Minikube with let's say AWX Ansible Tower at the same time, the processes will start contending for resources and you will get weird errors. For that reason, the below screenshot is my setup with 12G of RAM. For reference, I use an M1 Macbook Air with 16G or RAM as my personal laptop. I frequently run all of HashiQube's services to test with, for example, I'll run Vault, Nomad, Consul, Waypoint, Boundary and Minikube with Grafana and Prometheus to test the monitoring of Vault, Nomad and Consul, for that reason 4G Ram would not be enough.

![Docker Desktop Resources](images/docker_installed_resources.png?raw=true "Docker Desktop Resources")

* Ensure that you give your docker daemon at least __8G of RAM__ and sufficient disk space

## Consul DNS
__Local DNS via Consul__ <br />
Add on our local Macbook a file __/etc/resolver/consul__ with below contents
```
nameserver 10.9.99.10
port 8600
```
Now you can use DNS like nomad.service.consul:9999 vault.service.consul:9999 via Fabio Load Balancer <br />

Stderr: Error response from daemon: cannot stop container: 6c0c8135620ff47efe12df417a0df0e57d7a81a7f7ca06d011323fbb52e573db: tried to kill container, but did not receive an exit event
```

__Error__ The IP address configured for the host-only network is not within the allowed ranges. Please 
update the address used to be within the allowed ranges and run the command again. <br />
__Command__ `vagrant up --provision` <br /> 
__Solution__ Ensure the following contents are present in `/etc/vbox/networks.conf` <br>

```
* 10.0.0.0/8 192.168.0.0/16
* 2001::/64
```

__Error__ Vagrant cannot forward the specified ports on this VM, since they would collide with some other application that is already listening on these ports. The forwarded port to `9200` is already in use on the host machine.

To fix this, modify your current project's Vagrantfile to use another port. For example, where '1234' would be replaced by a unique host port: 

```
config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 9200, host: 1234
```

Sometimes, Vagrant will attempt to auto-correct this for you. In this case, Vagrant was unable to. This is usually because the guest machine is in a state which doesn't allow modifying port forwarding. You could try 'vagrant reload' (the equivalent of running a halt followed by an up) so vagrant can attempt to auto-correct this upon booting. Be warned that any unsaved work might be lost. <br />
__Command__ `vagrant up --provision` <br />
__Info__ When I run `vagrant up` I get an error about a port collision, in this case, it is port `9200` - The reason is that I have an Elasticsearch container running on my local laptop, and since HashiQube also run Elasticsearch this port is taken. <br />
__Solution__ I stop the Elasticsearch docker container and I run `vagrant up` again, or I hash the line out in the Vagrantfile like the example below <br />

```
# config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 9200, host: 9200 # elasticsearch
```
