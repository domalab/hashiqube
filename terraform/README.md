## üöÄ Introduction

In this HashiQube DevOps lab, you will get hands-on experience with HashiCorp Terraform. Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that enables users to define and provision datacenter infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.

### Why Terraform

- Provides a high-level abstraction of infrastructure (IaC)
- Allows for composition and combination
- Supports parallel management of resources (graph, fast)
- Separates planning from execution (dry-run)

Because of this flexibility, Terraform can be used to solve many different problems.

## üß© Terraform Basics

### Terraform Lifecycle

The Terraform lifecycle consists of the following four phases:

```bash
terraform init -> terraform plan -> terraform apply -> terraform destroy
```

### Terraform Language

HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) includes:

- Variables
- Outputs
- Resources
- Providers

Providers extend the language functionality to support Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for different platforms.

### Terraform Modules and Providers

Modules build and extend on the resources defined by providers:

|Modules | Providers|
|--------|----------|
|Container of multiple resources used together | Defines resource types that Terraform manages|
|Sourced through a registry or local files | Configure a specific infrastructure platform|
|Consists of .tf and/or .tf.json files | Contains instructions for API interactions|
|Re-usable Terraform configuration | Written in Go Language|
|Built on top of providers | Foundation for modules|

### Example Terraform Plan

Here's an example of what a `terraform plan` looks like:

```hcl
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

null_resource.ec2_instance_disk_allocations_indexed["3"]: Refreshing state... [id=8937245650602921629]
null_resource.ec2_instance_disk_allocations_indexed["5"]: Refreshing state... [id=7730763927227710655]
null_resource.ec2_instance_disk_allocations_indexed["1"]: Refreshing state... [id=2667993646128215089]
null_resource.ec2_instance_disk_allocations_indexed["2"]: Refreshing state... [id=2799175647628082337]
null_resource.ec2_instance_disk_allocations_indexed["4"]: Refreshing state... [id=3516596870015825764]
null_resource.ec2_instance_disk_allocations_indexed["0"]: Refreshing state... [id=2638599405833480007]
aws_s3_bucket.localstack-s3-bucket: Refreshing state... [id=localstack-s3-bucket]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_s3_bucket.localstack-s3-bucket will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "localstack-s3-bucket" {
      + acceleration_status         = (known after apply)
      + acl                         = "public-read"
      + arn                         = (known after apply)
      + bucket                      = "localstack-s3-bucket"
      + bucket_domain_name          = (known after apply)
      + bucket_regional_domain_name = (known after apply)
      + force_destroy               = false
      + hosted_zone_id              = (known after apply)
      + id                          = (known after apply)
      + region                      = (known after apply)
      + request_payer               = (known after apply)
      + website_domain              = (known after apply)
      + website_endpoint            = (known after apply)

      + versioning {
          + enabled    = (known after apply)
          + mfa_delete = (known after apply)
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Terraform Provisioner Script

The `terraform.sh` script handles the installation and configuration of Terraform:

```bash
[filename](terraform.sh ':include :type=code')
```

## üìä Terraform Best Practices

Watch this whiteboard video by Terraform co-creator Armon Dadgar to learn about high-scale Terraform best practices:

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Terraform Cloud

[![Introduction to Terraform Cloud](images/maxresdefault-terraform-cloud.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihAKcn9SE_M)

[Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/) is a SaaS platform that simplifies Terraform usage by:

- Managing state files remotely instead of locally
- Providing version control and backups for state files
- Enabling team collaboration and governance
- Centralizing runs with plan approvals
- Maintaining a history of all infrastructure changes

### Collaboration and Governance

Terraform Cloud adds several key capabilities to the Terraform workflow:

- Centralized runs through Terraform Cloud instead of direct provider access
- Complete history of all infrastructure changes
- Approval workflows for infrastructure changes
- Access control for team members
- Standardized Terraform workflows across teams

> üí° You can still use the same familiar `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands with Terraform Cloud - it automatically uses Terraform Cloud in the backend.

## üè¢ Terraform Enterprise

[Terraform Enterprise](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/index.html) is the self-hosted distribution of Terraform Cloud. It offers enterprises a private instance of the Terraform Cloud application, with no resource limits and additional enterprise-grade features like:

- Audit logging
- SAML single sign-on
- Advanced security controls

### Setup Instructions

1. Make sure you have a Terraform License file placed in the HashiCorp directory (e.g., `hashicorp/ptfe-license.rli`)
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   vagrant up --provision-with terraform-enterprise
   ```

3. System logs and Docker logs will be followed (in red). This is normal and for status output.
4. The installation takes a while. It will finish when Terraform Enterprise is ready.
5. When done, you'll see: `++++ To finish the installation go to http://10.9.99.10:8800`
